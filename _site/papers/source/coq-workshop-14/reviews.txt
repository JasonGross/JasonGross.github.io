PAPER: 14
TITLE: Presentation of Three Neat Tricks in Coq 8.5
AUTHORS: Jason Gross

OVERALL EVALUATION: 2 (accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (high)

----------- REVIEW -----------
This talk is just what the title says: three neat tricks that work in
Coq 8.5.  They showcase the interaction between Gallina and Ltac code.
I was intrigued by the examples in the proposal, but they could have
been a bit more compelling with a few "practical" use cases.  (I don't
doubt that these tricks would be useful, but it would be good if the
author could make the case for their uses better motivated.)

This could be a fun talk.

PAPER: 14
TITLE: Presentation of Three Neat Tricks in Coq 8.5
AUTHORS: Jason Gross

OVERALL EVALUATION: 1 (weak accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 4 (high)

----------- REVIEW -----------
The proposal presents three neat tricks that can be done in Coq 8.5
because of the addition of allowing tactics in terms. I expect that
these tricks would lead to a nice presentation at the workshop.

I wonder, however, whether these tricks are actually useful.  I would
therefore recommend that the presentation does not focus merely on the
implementation of each trick, but rather on how these may be used
(esp. the notation overloading one as I couldn't really follow it).

Regarding the first trick (recursive tactics), I suspect one can
already do this with Mtac, so perhaps it could just be eliminated in
favor of spending more time on the other two tricks.

PAPER: 14
TITLE: Presentation of Three Neat Tricks in Coq 8.5
AUTHORS: Jason Gross

OVERALL EVALUATION: -1 (weak reject)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 3 (medium)

----------- REVIEW -----------
The paper presents three uses of a new feature of Coq 8.5, namely the
possibility to include ltac expressions in an arbitrary Coq term,
giving the possibility to build subterms by tactics. This is a very
interesting feature, worth to be advertised. My main concern is that I
found the three examples not so convincing, both in what they achieve
and in the way they are written, also the explanations are not very
clear, with emphasis on current bugs rather than general ideas. So I
am concerned it will not result in a very interesting presentation.

PAPER: 14
TITLE: Presentation of Three Neat Tricks in Coq 8.5
AUTHORS: Jason Gross

OVERALL EVALUATION: 2 (accept)
REVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 3 (medium)

----------- REVIEW -----------
This is a kind of "super-advanced user feedback" talk. A sophisticated
user is doing things to Coq 8.5 which will give others even more ideas
for (ab)use. I think this paper is somewhere between "accept and "weak
accept". The weakness comes from the fact that the abstract reads like
a presentation of three clever hacks, without regard to more general
issues. Can the hacks be used more generally? Are there lessons to be
learned, or can the author offer some suggestions to the Coq
developers? But I think I can go with "accept" because the hacks are
in fact quite neat.
