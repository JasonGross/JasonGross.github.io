- Combine "Functoriality" (section 5) with "A type system for
  categories" (section 6.1.2)

- Turn "Category Theory Constructions" (Appendix A) into a bulleted
  list with citations

- Fill in citations

- remove all things labeled FIX or FIXME after fixing them

- remove use of "I"

- write abstract

- fix author, category, keywords, boilerplate, etc

- decide whether or not Cat (and Set) should be set in tt, and
  implement/uniformize decision

- fix overfull/underfull box warnings

- remove footnotes

- make equality section more tutorial

- map my category theory constructions to those of other libraries

- elaborate on nested sums vs nested products:

  > Adam:
  >> I don't see what the problem is with nested products vs. sums in
  >> Coq.  How could you do any better than a big [match] for a fancy
  >> sum?

- explain polarity and positive vs negative characterizations more

- 2.1.4: The use of the set name "A" confuses me in a few places.  It
  reminds me of some of the careless use of "variable binding" in
  informal math, which we should be able to avoid. :)

- 2.1.6 uses category theory terminology before introducing it.

- explain "strict 1-category", etc.

- add more detail to reified simplification ("Section 3.2 seems like a
  big missed opportunity to explain something cool in detail (and
  still with examples).")

- ""because I have not yet found a way to code that the two Fs in
  F(m1) o F(m2) are the same": this sounds trivial to do using
  standard techniques for proof by reflection, as demonstrated in the
  appropriate CPDT chapter and elsewhere.  We should talk about the
  issues at some point."

- some performance benchmarks  (Which ones? -jgross)

- consider explaining Yoneda lemma

- "There should be a section or subsection early in the paper
  explaining the hot open design issues in Coq and related systems
  today (e.g., homotopy type theory, universe polymorphism), and then
  we can relate to those issues later in the paper, saying how our
  experiences provide evidence for different choices."

- "It would be lovely to have some concrete examples of the
  "robustness" of category theory, as you call it.  That is, show some
  constructions where details are implied by initial choices."

- "Section 5, "Functoriality," doesn't seem long enough to justify a
  section."

- "Some of the future work seems too detailed.  Future work is supposed
  to somehow shed light on interesting limitations or consequences of
  the results from the paper, not just give a to-do list of planned
  research.  I don't think you motivate the specifics of some of the
  future work items enough that the reader will care about the
  details.  Shorter descriptions of some of these would be more
  worthwhile."

- figure out whether strict 1-categories (and h-sets) are properly
  called 0-truncated, or 1-truncated.  I think -2-truncated is
  contractible, -1-truncated is a mere proposition, so 0-truncated
  should be h-sets, but I've seen UIP called the 1-truncation axiom
  (e.g., at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~megacz/coq-categories/), and
  am not certain I got the numbers right
