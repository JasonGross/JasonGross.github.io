  abstract = {L{\"o}b's theorem states that to prove that a proposition is provable, it is sufficient to prove the proposition under the assumption that it is provable.
    The Curry-Howard isomorphism identifies formal proofs with abstract syntax trees of programs; L{\"o}b's theorem thus implies, for total languages which validate it, that self-interpreters are impossible.
    We formalize a few variations of L{\"o}b's theorem in Agda using an inductive-inductive encoding of terms indexed over types.
    We verify the consistency of our formalizations relative to Agda by giving them semantics via interpretation functions.},

  abstract = {We present a functional parser for arbitrary context-free grammars, together with soundness and completeness proofs, all inside Coq.
    By exposing the parser in the right way with parametric polymorphism and dependent types, we are able to use the parser to prove its own
    soundness, and, with a little help from relational parametricity, prove its own completeness, too.
    Of particular interest is one strange instantiation of the type and value parameters: by parsing \emph{parse
    trees} instead of strings, we convince the parser to generate its own completeness proof.
    We conclude with highlights of our experiences iterating through several versions of the Coq development, and some general lessons about dependently typed programming.},
