<p style="text-align: center;">Hello!</p>

I'm excited about understanding and securing software systems.
My current projects are in formally verifying transformer models and using mechanistic interpretability for anomaly detection.
<!--Until recently, I was a researcher at the [Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org/).--!>
<!--Humanity is building AI systems to be subject to fewer constraints of the world, let's not be subject to the AI systems either.-->
<!--I'm bushwhacking for moonshots that make this possible!-->

Previously, I developed [Fiat Cryptography](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto) which [enables the majority of secure connections to the internet](https://andres.systems/fiat-crypto-adoption.html) (the big prime numbers behind the https lock icon). 
Over the course of the project, I reported [the plurality of all-time bugs in the proof-assistant Coq]({{ "/media/coq-bug-reports-by-year.svg" | relative_url }}) because [proof assistants are systematically slow](https://youtu.be/m-iGCCuHBvY) when you apply them to real world problems. If we want verified security at scale, we need significantly more performant ways of generating and checking formal proofs!

I live in the Bay Area, and I like to [sail](https://www.cal-sailing.org/).
Reach out if you want to chat, or do water sports!
<!--If the stakes weren't so high, I would spend more time on cute maker projects, sailing, dancing, [circling](https://web.mit.edu/~jgross/Public/social-interactions/circling.txt), and physics.-->

<!--[reflective rewriting](https://github.com/mit-plv/rewriter), [verified cryptographic primitive synthesis](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat-crypto), [general program synthesis](https://github.com/mit-plv/fiat)-->

  What I do, [with only the ten-hundred most used words](https://xkcd.com/1133/) (checked by [The Up-Goer Five Words Typing-Box](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/)): It would be nice if we could tell computers what should happen in only a few simple words, and the computers would just know how to do it right and how do it quickly.  And it would be even nicer if using these computers led to us doing more and becoming more, rather than to us getting left behind. I'm working on making this dream come true.

<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies and Fun Facts</h2>
I enjoy wind-surfing, sailing, sky-diving, programming, philosophy, dancing ((&mu;-)fusion, blues, squares, ceili(dh), contra), [circling](https://web.mit.edu/~jgross/Public/social-interactions/circling.txt), math, physics, learning, building, and glassblowing.  I've written up [some thoughts on social interactions and emotions](https://web.mit.edu/jgross/Public/social-interactions/), [my experience skydiving](https://web.mit.edu/jgross/Public/stories/skydive.txt), [a couple of other personal stories](https://web.mit.edu/~jgross/Public/stories/), [a visual proof that the reals are uncountable, geared at a child](https://web.mit.edu/jgross/Public/18.100C_paper_newest.pdf), [a term paper on quantum decoherence](https://web.mit.edu/~jgross/Public/8_06-decoherence-paper.pdf).
I also took an introduction to music composition, and the pieces I created are [here](https://web.mit.edu/~jgross/Public/21M.065/).

As far as I know, my Erd√∂s Number is 5, because [Adam Chlipala](http://adam.chlipala.net/)'s is 4.
