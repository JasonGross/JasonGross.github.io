  abstract = {
    Software-based fault isolation (SFI), as used in Google's Native Client (NaCl),
    relies upon a conceptually simple machine-code analysis to enforce a security 
    policy.  But for complicated architectures such as the x86, it is all too easy
    to get the details of the analysis wrong.  We have built a new checker that is
    smaller, faster, and has a much reduced trusted computing base when compared
    to Google's original analysis.  The key to our approach is automatically 
    generating the bulk of the analysis from a declarative description which we
    relate to a formal model of a subset of the x86 instruction architecture. 
    The x86 model, developed in Coq, is of independent interest and should be
    usable for a wide range of machine-level verification tasks.
