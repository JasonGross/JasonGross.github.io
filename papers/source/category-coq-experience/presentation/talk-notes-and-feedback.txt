Notes from MSR
Get remote (ask ToyBox/IT), and bring batteries

Record self giving presentation

Avoid animations in the background when talking

Add more words/relevant pictures to show when I’m talking for a while

Say what I did at the beginning
	Mention lessons
	Make promotion of library
	“I did library, but I’m going to be talking about experience”

Put exponential laws example first, then talk about the outline

Say who the talk is for

Look into Mizar (types outside of logic)

71 – make size smaller, include full term

Initial vertex has unique edges (50)

Fix water drop animation

I say “uh” too much

Mention on “how theorem provers should work” (~13) that it’s ok to not know category theory

Move “do terms actually get this large” to after plots (26-28)

32 – remove “fixing 0-arrows”, let intuition fill in beyond “turn arrows into vertices”

Idea of transporting across equality is uncommon, say “cast using equality”

Include images for talking about examples (such as funext, generalization) around 61

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nesting is repeated binary operation

Don’t say “Thing” in answers

Recap – can describe next steps, take home points at end (at most 3 points)

_Computational Category Theory_ by Whitehead
















Remove hidden slides
Include image of person asking Coq if proof on blackboard is valid
Include images on "two options" slide (38)







Fix slide size - Design -> Slide Size -> 4:3
Don't use pronouns ("this vertex", not "this"), don't need to use laser pointer (don't want to need to)
Look into copyright issues with images (creative commons, cc)
Only cover some points, point at paper for rest
Don't focus on using higher inductive types, but on how they let you avoid setoids


Animation: exponential laws, whiteboard -> Coq example/animation "straightforward" -> "is slow", maybe adjoint composition (at beginning) (gold standard is "math on whiteboard -> coq says yes/no)


Combine lattices with graphs

Mention category theory names on slide, with standard convention uniform across slides and sign posts

Note that category theory stresses the proof assistant, mention, e.g., three primary techniques, concrete examples

Make abstraction barrier example way more concrete


Mention: "I did this library, these are the issues I ran into"




Same rooster in all slides



----------------------------------------


Circus-ready slide:
Doesn't say anything about talk, doesn't convey useful information, takes time to explain, un-useful




Squiggly lines from abstract category theory to Coq, why the line is squiggly is why the talk is interesting

Less text at beginning, more pictures


Slide 18, "What do proof assistants do?" - not question, too ill-defined - make it more specific to Coq

Slide 23, "How large is slow?" - make question clearer verbally, maybe - add to notes, what do I mean by "slow"


highlight things relevant to users vs. developers (hash consing)


note to hide the taskbar



Put projections first, make example about opaque nesting clearer



Slide 35, different sizes of roosters, maybe, or actual duplicated code
Maybe include on a list of things I didn't have time to include

Clear outline early on (preview of names of techniques, without explanation)

First towards users, then towards devs

Fewer things, more time on each one


Move proof by reflection to list; no interesting conlcusions, keep image/joke in a non-technical part at beginning


Note: don't explain setoids to people who don't know them


Group slides into "messages for experts" where I don't explain too many things.  Don't include (much?) explanation of HITs




Two options: abstract things from user point of view (fence), or into the metatheory (bionic rooster?)


Outline

Fix lack of field name for edges in graph record, colors in IsGraph

Pause between intros of Mapping, IsMapping, hide IsMapping at first


Move duality earlier
Maybe include one example (note that judgmentality is important)

Fix duality image 56->57

Add more pictures to ConCaT slide, people don't know ConCaT; ask Bas about ssr, mathclasses, flatness


Recap, conclusions at end (things in library, things I talked about, can jog memory of questions, url to library)


Try to arrange practice talk at MSR

Talk to Georges


Use vector rooster


sigT <-> sig coercions and projections break abstraction barriers
