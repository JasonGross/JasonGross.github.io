The directory HoTT contains the HoTT/HoTT library, on top of which my
category theory library is built.  The category theory is in
HoTT/theories/categories.  There is a table of contents of the entire
library at HoTT/html/toc.html, and an index at HoTT/html/index.html.
The table of contents, generated by coqdoc, has a large swath of
sections on category theory (all with 'categories' in their name), and
under each section is a brief listing of the category theory developed
in that file.  There are more documentation files available at
https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/wiki.  There is also an table of contents
for interactive documentation at
http://hott.github.io/HoTT/proviola-html/toc.html.

Note: What is called a "precategory" in the code is called a
"category" in the paper; this was done for the benefit of audiences
not familiar with homotopy type theory, but familiar with category
theory, for whom the details of what a precategory is in homotopy type
theory don't matter much for the purposes of the paper.
