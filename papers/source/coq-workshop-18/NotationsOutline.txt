Syntax of notations (e.g., \texttt{Infix "+" := add.}; \texttt{Notation "a + b" := (add a b).})
Notation bodies must be parenthesized
How to use levels and associativity, how to pick levels, how to discover levels of existing notations (\texttt{Print Grammar constr})
Controlling display: \texttt{format}, extra spaces, quoting symbols, boxes in \texttt{format} for display of indentation, newlines, and whitespace
Recursive notations: \texttt{..} for pair- and $\lambda$-like things
\texttt{Reserved Notation} and \texttt{only printing}, useful for ensuring that notations don't conflict
Using single-variable only-printing notations for hiding identifiers
Abbreviations vs notations (what it means when your \texttt{Notation} doesn't have quotes, and why you might want this)
Notation scopes, useful for overloading notations and selecting the right one automatically (\texttt{Bind Scope}, \texttt{Delimit Scope}, \texttt{Open Scope})
Using binders for destructuring pairs
Parenthesizing notations: when to use parentheses, and when to use levels
Deliberate ordering of notations: how to express wildcard and negation in notation matching
