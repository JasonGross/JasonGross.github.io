It wasn't something I thought would make sense to add to the test suite anyway.","I thought coqbot was too eager to remind us of the minimizer, although that's probably more relevant for the coqbot maintainers than for you. Even though it wasn't useful for this PR, I used the minimizer privately once and it was helpful then. Thank you for making it available."

I however understand that a trade off must be found between making the minimizer visible and minimizing its noise (no pun intended) and I don't have any good answer (I feel things might have improved a bit since then, but that's just a feeling)."
