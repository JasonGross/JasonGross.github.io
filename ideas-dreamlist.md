This is a list of ideas that might turn into projects.
More out-there than the [Projects Wishlist](/projects-wishlist).

1. Build a toy model for the relationship (if any) between inequality of opportunity and non-hyperbolic discounting.
    - As I understand it, hyperbolic discounting (combined with finite life span?) gives rise to exploring more early in life and exploiting more later in life.
    - It seems like successful people exploit more early in life and explore more later in life, suggesting that successful people might not be hyperbolic discounters?
    - Is there a way to set up, e.g., RL environments that vary the optimal explore-expoit tradeoffs?
      e.g., tweaking:
      - if agents start with some initial wealth, and initial wealth increases opportunities...
      - compound accumulation of reward?
