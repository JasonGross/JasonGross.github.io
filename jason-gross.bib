  abstract = {We describe our experience implementing a broad category-theory library
	in Coq.  Category theory and computational performance are not usually
	mentioned in the same breath, but we have needed substantial engineering
	effort to teach Coq to cope with large categorical constructions
	without slowing proof script processing unacceptably.  In this paper,
	we share the lessons we have learned about how to represent very
	abstract mathematical objects and arguments in Coq and how future
	proof assistants might be designed to better support such reasoning.
	 One particular encoding trick to which we draw attention allows
	category-theoretic arguments involving \emph{duality} to be internalized
	in Coq's logic with definitional equality.  Ours may be the largest
	Coq development to date that uses the relatively new Coq version
	developed by homotopy type theorists, and we reflect on which new
	features were especially helpful.},
