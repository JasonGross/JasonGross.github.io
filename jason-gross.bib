  title = {Experience Implementing a Performant Category-Theory Library in {C}oq},
  note = {Draft; to be submitted to ITP 2014},
  month = {July},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {We describe our experience implementing a broad category-theory library
	in Coq. Category theory and computational performance are not usually
	mentioned in the same breath, but we have needed substantial engineering
	effort to teach Coq to cope with large categorical constructions
	without slowing proof script processing unacceptably. In this paper,
	we share the lessons we have learned about how to represent very
	abstract mathematical objects and arguments in Coq and how future
	proof assistants might be designed to better support such reasoning.
	One particular encoding trick to which we draw attention allows category-theoretic
	arguments involving \emph{duality} to be internalized in Coq's logic
	with definitional equality. Ours may be the largest Coq development
	to date that uses the relatively new Coq version developed by homotopy
	type theorists, and we reflect on which new features were especially
	helpful.},

  abstract = {People can learn visual concepts from just one example, but it remains
	a mystery how this is accomplished. Many authors have proposed that
	transferred knowledge from more familiar concepts is a route to one
	shot learning, but what is the form of this abstract knowledge? One
	hypothesis is that the sharing of parts is core to one shot learning,
	and we evaluate this idea in the domain of handwritten characters,
	using a massive new dataset. These simple visual concepts have a
	rich internal part structure, yet they are particularly tractable
	for computational models. We introduce a generative model of how
	characters are composed from strokes, where knowledge from previous
	characters helps to infer the latent strokes in novel characters.
	The stroke model outperforms a competing state-of-the-art character
	model on a challenging one shot learning task, and it provides a
	good fit to human perceptual data.},
