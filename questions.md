If you have thoughts on the following (or impossibility intuitions), Iâ€™m all ears!

1. Proof engines that avoid superlinear slowness
2. Translating large proofs into compact proofs
3. Translating compact proofs into human-understandable insights
4. Properties and assumptions that imply multipolarity in the steady state
5. Unbounded utility functions that prefer an anti-inductive world
6. Decision theories that make subject-object shifts
7. Measuring performative power in complex systems
